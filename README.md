# deep_learning_image_segmentation
-  Understand the Segmentation Dataset and you will write a custom dataset class for Image-mask dataset. Additionally,  you will apply segmentation augmentation to augment images as well as its masks. For image-mask augmentation you will use albumentation library. You will plot the image-Mask pair.

- Load a pretrained state of the art convolutional neural network for segmentation problem(for e.g, Unet) using segmentation model pytorch library. 

- Create train function and evaluator function which will helpful to write training loop. Moreover, you will use training loop to train the model.
